## Built with
Pure Vanilla JS - HTML, CSS and Javascript.

OMDb API - For API generation

## Setup instructions
Clone the repo

Live serve the index.html file in browser

## Factors considered when determining the technical & architectural choices
For its technical aspects I used Javascript for its DOM manipulation capabilities to enable maximum dynamic architecture and integrations.

Also made sure all aspects are rendered timously and all api queries are executed for user experience and performance.

## What I would do differently if I was allocated more time
A bit more research and add more super dynamic features. 

Also would have considered having used postgresql for storing added movies in a database.
